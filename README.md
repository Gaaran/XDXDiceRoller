A discord bot that roll some dice. I did it in the dirtiest way as the idea came to me. So please forgive this trashy code :)

edit 1 : I did some cool update on it, I've refactor some old code ( I left it as comment ) to adapt it to the DSharpPlusCommandNext, it comes easyer, I have not refactor the basic method code yet, but I plan to do it very soon !

edit 2 : I've made again the whole basic code, it... work ? YES it does few things new, ignore the State.cs atm.
